# ERC20-token-polygon Hardhat Project with API in node.js

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a smart contract token, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract. APIs to perform several tasks on the smart contract directly.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node

// To compile the contract
npx hardhat compile

// To deploy the contract on Polygon testnet/mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```
